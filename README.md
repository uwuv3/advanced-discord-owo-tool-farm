    Hello there, my name is Eternityy, and I wanted to take a moment to thank you for using our tool.

    Since 2021, this project has been non-profit. But we're still committed to making it the best it can be, 
    
    With APIs like captcha-solving and quoting,... to help make your experience better and more efficient.

    Unfortunately, funding has become an obstacle to our progress. Would you be willing to help us out with a small donation? 
    
    Even the price of a coffee cup can go a long way towards keeping us going. Every little bit helps, means the world to us.

    Thank you for your time and consideration, and we hope you continue to enjoy our tool!
